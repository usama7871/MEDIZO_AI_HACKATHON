# **App Name**: SimuPatient

## Core Features:

- AI Physiology Engine: Develop and train ML models using Vertex AI to simulate patient responses, pathology, and disease progression. LLM to decides whether to present comorbidities.
- Interactive Virtual Patient: Leverage Vertex AI to enable interactive questioning and dynamic vital sign/disease progression displays, guided by a tool to choose what to prioritize to make the interaction useful
- Training Scenario Management: Use Vertex AI to create and manage various training scenarios, including personalized cases generated from datasets, incorporating a tool that analyzes past simulations to choose the correct scenario
- Dynamic Visualization: Real-time display of vital signs and disease progression via charts and graphs.
- Question and Answer Interface: Allows students to ask questions and receive simulated responses.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey professionalism and trust.
- Background color: Light blue (#E8EAF6), a desaturated variant of the primary for a calming effect.
- Accent color: Violet (#7E57C2) to add a modern touch and highlight interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern user interface.
- Use a consistent set of modern line icons to represent different functions and data types.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout with clear sections for patient information, vital signs, and interactive elements.
